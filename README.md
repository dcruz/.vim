## .vim folder
### Info
This is my `.vim/` folder that contains all the plugins and configurations that I need on vim.

### Install
To install these settings just do a `git clone` in your home directory:
	git clone git://github.com/rogeriopvl/.vim.git

Then create two symbolic links for `vimrc` and for `gvimrc`:
	ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
	ln -s ~/.vim/gvimrc ~/.gvimrc
